# HTTP Server

A simple HTTP server that serves static files.

Currently it:
  - only works on Linux;
  - only supports GET requests in origin-form;
  - is not compliant with any HTTP spec.

Maybe I'll make it HTTP/1.1 (and later) compliant.

The code in this project is based on the [C Fundamentals](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/c-fundamentals/) course from [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/).
